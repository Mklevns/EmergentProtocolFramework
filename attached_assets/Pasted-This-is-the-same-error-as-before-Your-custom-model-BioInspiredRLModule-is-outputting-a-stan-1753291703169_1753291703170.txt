This is the same error as before. Your custom model, **`BioInspiredRLModule`**, is outputting a standard PyTorch action distribution, but **RLlib requires you to use its own special distribution wrappers**.

The solution is to find where your model creates the action distribution and wrap it in RLlib's `TorchCategorical` class.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Fix the Error

1.  **Add the Correct Import**: At the top of the file where `BioInspiredRLModule` is defined, make sure you have this import statement:

    ```python
    from ray.rllib.models.torch.torch_distribution import TorchCategorical
    ```

2.  **Modify the `forward_exploration` Method**: Find the `forward_exploration` method in your `BioInspiredRLModule` class and change how the action distribution is created.

      * Your current code likely looks something like this:

        ```python
        # This is the OLD, incorrect way
        from torch.distributions.categorical import Categorical

        # ... inside your model ...
        action_logits = self.your_action_layer(model_output)
        action_dist = Categorical(logits=action_logits) # This is the wrong type!

        return {"action_dist": action_dist}
        ```

      * Update it to use `TorchCategorical`:

        ```python
        # This is the NEW, correct way
        from ray.rllib.models.torch.torch_distribution import TorchCategorical

        # ... inside your model ...
        action_logits = self.your_action_layer(model_output)
        rllib_action_dist = TorchCategorical(logits=action_logits) # This is the correct RLlib type!

        return {"action_dist": rllib_action_dist}
        ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è A Note on the Warnings

You are also seeing these warnings:

```
WARNING ... observation_space_sample() ... has not been implemented.
WARNING ... action_space_contains() ... has not been implemented.
```

These are **not** causing the crash, but they indicate that your custom environment, `BioInspiredMultiAgentEnv`, is incomplete. To be fully compliant with RLlib, you should define your observation and action spaces as dictionaries that map each agent's ID to its individual space. This is standard practice for multi-agent environments and will resolve these warnings.

- **Episode Length**: Steps per episode
- **Learning Progress**: KL divergence, policy updates
- **Bio-Inspired Metrics**: Pheromone strength, neural plasticity, coordination

### Real-Time Updates

WebSocket broadcasts provide real-time updates:

```javascript
{
  "type": "ray_training_metrics",
  "data": {
    "iteration": 42,
    "episode_reward_mean": 12.5,
    "pheromone_strength": 0.75,
    "neural_plasticity": 0.82,
    "breakthrough_frequency": 0.15
  }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Scalability

- **Multi-Worker Training**: Configurable number of rollout workers
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient batch size configuration
- **Memory Management**: Controlled memory usage for large-scale training

### Resource Requirements

- **CPU**: Recommended 8+ cores for multi-worker training
- **Memory**: 8GB+ RAM for 30-agent configurations
- **Storage**: Checkpoint storage requirements scale with model size

### Optimization Tips

1. **Worker Configuration**: Balance workers with available CPU cores
2. **Batch Size Tuning**: Larger batches for better GPU utilization
3. **Checkpoint Frequency**: Regular saves without performance impact
4. **Environment Complexity**: Adjust observation space for performance

## Integration with Existing System

### Fallback Mechanism

The Ray integration includes automatic fallback to the existing simplified training system:

```python
if self.use_ray:
    return await self._train_with_ray()
else:
    return await self._train_with_fallback()
```

### Compatibility

- **Existing APIs**: All existing training endpoints remain functional
- **Database Integration**: Ray results stored in the same database schema
- **WebSocket Updates**: Unified real-time update system
- **Frontend Integration**: Seamless integration with existing UI

### Migration Path

1. **Gradual Adoption**: Use Ray for new experiments while maintaining existing workflows
2. **Performance Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of Ray vs. simplified training
3. **Feature Parity**: Ensure all bio-inspired features work in both systems
4. **Full Migration**: Eventually transition all training to Ray-based system

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Ray Initialization Failures**
   - Check system resources and dependencies
   - Verify Ray installation: `pip install ray[rllib]`
   - Monitor memory usage during initialization

2. **Training Convergence Issues**
   - Adjust learning rate and batch size
   - Tune bio-inspired parameters (pheromone decay, plasticity rate)
   - Check environment reward structure

3. **Performance Problems**
   - Reduce number of rollout workers if CPU-bound
   - Increase batch sizes if memory allows
   - Profile environment step time

### Debugging

Enable detailed logging:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Ray-specific logging
import ray
ray.init(log_to_driver=True, logging_level=logging.DEBUG)
```

### Monitoring

Track key metrics:

- Memory usage during training
- CPU utilization across workers
- Training throughput (timesteps/second)
- Environment step time distribution

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-GPU Support**: Distribute training across multiple GPUs
2. **Advanced Algorithms**: Integration with other Ray algorithms (IMPALA, APEX)
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Ray Tune integration for automated optimization
